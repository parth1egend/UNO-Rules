# UNO 

## Table of Contents

## Start

- The person who shuffles starts the game.
- Shuffling person randomly decided.
- 7 cards to all.
- We go in clockwise order.

## Cards in Hand

- Showing the number of cards is mandatory.

## Last Card Rule

- `UNO` can be called out before playing your 2nd last card.
- `CAUGHT` can only be called out after the 2nd last card has landed on the deck being played. It cannot be called when the card is in transition from the player's hand to the deck.
- If the second last card is played and the player forgot's to say `UNO` before playing, he can say after the card has landed or while in transition.
  - If he says `UNO` while in transition , he cannot be caught.
  - Otherwise, if someone says `CAUGHT` before him, he draws `same amount of cards - 2` as we started as starting deck.
  - If it seems both the sounds came together at the same time, `CAUGHT` will be counted and favor will be on other's side.


## Main Game

### There is a `7` of `RED`

- `7` or `RED` card can be played. 
- If you have `7` of `BLUE` and `7` of `GREEN`, both cards can be played together in any order.
- If you have `6` of `RED` and `6` of `GREEN`, both cards can be played, but first `RED` card has to be played.

#### Power Up Card

- You can play a `+2` of `RED` color.
  - Only one card can be played; if you have another `+2` of `ANY` color, you can't play it.
- The one who got a `+2`, say Parth;
  - He has to draw 2 cards.
  - If Parth has `+2`, he can counter and pass on `4` to the next player.
  - The next playher can continue in the same way. 
  - BUT ONLY `+2` and `+4` can be used to continue the counter attacks.
  - Now Parth plays `+4` to counter attack;
    - Parth chooses the color but does not play the card.
- You can play `+4`.
  - You can choose the color but do not play any other card.You only choose the color and announce it.
  - `+4` can be countered with only `+4`. The next person can choose the color.
- The person who picks up the card has to pick up the cards and then has his turn to play his turn. From here on any streak gets broken and new streak of `+2` or `+4` starts.
- All other Power Up cards; `Skip`, `Reverse`; can be played just like the normal cards;
